# Project 1: Stock Market Analysis 
  I fetched the stock data of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon from yahoo financial source and analysed how all the stocks are 
  performing, whether their performace is correlated with one another or not, performed risk analysis of the amount you are betting on it 
  and expected returns based on daily avaerage return of those stocks. I have used bootstrap method and Monte Carlo simulation for risk     
  value analysis

  people being polled, percentage of votes won according to various polls, number of candidates running from each party, sentiments of 
  people changing over the time, amount of donations received from different professionals etc.
