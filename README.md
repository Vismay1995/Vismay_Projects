# Project 1: Titanic Cruze Accident
  I have imported the dataset from Kaggle.com and tried to analyse the reasons behind a person's survival or death during the accident. 
  The parameters I considered during my analysis and visualiztion are age of the person, gender of the person, whether they were with    
  family or alone, in what class they were travelling, and on what deck of the cruze they were staying
  
# Project 2: Stock Market Analysis 
  I fetched the stock data of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon from yahoo financial source and analysed how all the stocks are 
  performing, whether their performace is correlated with each other or not, performed risk analysis of the amount you are betting on it a   and expected returns based on daily avaerage return of those stocks. I have used bootstrap method and monte carlo simulation for risk     
  value analysis

  polled, percentage of votes won according to various polls, number of candidated running from each party, sentiments of people changing 
  over the time, amount of donations received from different professionals etc.
