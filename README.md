# Vismay_Projects
# 1st Project is about Titanic Cruze Sinking incident: I have imported the dataset from Kaggle.com and tried to analyse what were the 
  reasons behind a person's survival or death during the accident. The parameters I considered were there age, gender, whether they were
  with family or alone, and in what class they were travelling
  
# 2nd project is Stock MArket analysis where I have imported stock data of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon and performed risk analysis
  of the amount you are betting on it and expected return based on daily avaerage return of those stocks. I used bootstrap method and 
  monte carlo simulation for risk value analysis
  
# 3rd project is election 2012 poll analysis to observe who was favourable to get elected and how much donations both the; Republican and
  democrat party, were receiving from different professionals. I have considered different polling results, probability of both ;Obama or
  Romney; winning the election, sentiment of people changing over the time, amount of donation both the parties received etc.
