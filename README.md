# Project 1: Titanic Cruise Ship Accident
  I have imported the dataset from Kaggle.com and tried to analyse the reasons behind a person's survival or death during the accident. 
  The parameters I considered during my analysis and visualization are age of the person, gender of the person, whether they were with 
  family or alone, in what class they were travelling, and on what deck of the cruise they were staying
  
# Project 2: Stock Market Analysis 
  I fetched the stock data of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon from yahoo financial source and analysed how all the stocks are 
  performing, whether their performace is correlated with one another or not, performed risk analysis of the amount you are betting on it 
  and expected returns based on daily avaerage return of those stocks. I have used bootstrap method and Monte Carlo simulation for risk     
  value analysis
  
# Project 3: 2012 USA Election Poll Analysis
  Analysed who was a favourable candidate to get elected and why; from Romney and Obama, based on different parameters such as number of 
  people being polled, percentage of votes won according to various polls, number of candidates running from each party, sentiments of 
  people changing over the time, amount of donations received from different professionals etc.
